## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: Decentralized Identity Music Badge
- **Category**: identity

### Description
- Decentralized Identity Music Badge is a reputation and credential system for the music ecosystem.
Artists, fans, and contributors earn verifiable identity badges that reflect their participation and achievements in the community—such as attending concerts, supporting artists, creating playlists, or contributing to projects.
These badges are non-transferable (soulbound-style) and help prevent fake reputations, while enabling fair recognition of genuine contributions.

### SL Integration  
Soundness Layer (SL) will be used to:
- Verify actions (concert check-ins, playlist curation, artist support) with zero-knowledge proofs.
- Generate proofs of authenticity and prevent bot manipulation of identity reputation.
- Provide a secure credential layer so badges are tamper-proof and fully auditable.

## Technical

### Architecture
1. User Actions → (Attend event, tip artist, playlist contribution).
2. SL Proof Generation → Verifies the action with reduced blob/proof overhead.
3. Credential Issuer → Issues a unique badge stored on-chain.
4. Badge Registry (Smart Contract) → Manages ownership and badge metadata.
5. Frontend Dashboard → Users can view badges, reputation, and milestones.

### Stack
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (EVM compatible)
- **Proofs**: Soundness Layer CLI & SDK
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express
- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind

### Features
1. On-chain non-transferable badges tied to verified actions.
2. Reputation dashboard for users and artists.
3. SL-powered verification to prevent fraud and bots.

## Timeline

### PoC (2-4 weeks)
- [ ] Set up SL integration for proof generation
- [ ] Deploy a basic badge smart contract
- [ ] Simple CLI tool to issue badges for verified actions

### MVP (4-8 weeks)  
- [ ] Build full frontend dashboard for badge display
- [ ] Implement multiple badge types (event attendance, playlist creation, tipping support)
- [ ] Launch developer docs and testnet integration

## Innovation
- This vApp introduces a verifiable, fraud-resistant reputation layer for the music community. Unlike centralized badges, these identity proofs are decentralized, tamper-proof, and powered by Soundness Layer—ensuring authenticity and scalability.
